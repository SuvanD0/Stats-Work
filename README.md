# Stats Work in R

This repository contains code examples and analyses for various statistical topics relevant to machine learning and computational statistics models. The topics covered in separate files include:

- Descriptive Statistics: Calculation of central tendency and variability measures, such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation.
- Hypothesis Testing: Examples of statistical tests to determine whether sample data supports a hypothesis or not. Includes t-tests, chi-squared tests, and confidence interval calculations.
- Covariance and Correlation: Calculation of covariance matrices and correlation matrices for data exploration and model selection.
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): Estimation of model parameters using maximum likelihood estimation methods for various probability distributions, such as normal, binomial, and Poisson.
- Method of Moments (MOM): Estimation of model parameters using the method of moments for various distributions, such as exponential, gamma, and Weibull.
- Estimators: Calculation of point estimators, such as sample mean and sample variance, and evaluation of estimator bias and efficiency.
- P-value: Calculation of p-values for statistical tests to assess the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis.

## Replication Instructions

To replicate the analyses in this repository, run the R Markdown file included in each topic's folder. Before running the code, make sure to install all necessary packages listed at the beginning of each Markdown file. After installing the packages, run the code in each section by selecting it and pressing the "Run" button.
